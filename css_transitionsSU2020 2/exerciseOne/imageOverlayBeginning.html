      <h2>what's this all about then?</h2>
      <p>As a company of artists, ...was compelled to create a platform that not only celebrates artmakers and their work, but also illuminates the complicated, messy and exhilarating process of creation. This was our way of giving back to and deepening relationships with those who enrich our aesthetic 
and stir our senses. Unedited and unreserved, the stories we share represent spirit and craft in their rawest forms, and were made just for us.</p>
